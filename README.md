# Mission to Mars Challenge

## Purpose 
In this module I scraped text and images from a few sites by creating a python script that executed scraping functions and put the data in a Mongo database. I then created an HTML file to show the output of the data, with a button that would refresh the data (using the script). I also adjusted the HTML file to ensure it is browser friendly, added a footer with information on who created the page, and updated the CSS to make the footer blue.
